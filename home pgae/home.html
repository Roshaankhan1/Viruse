                <h4>What is <span>Virus</span>?</h4>
                <p>A virus is a microscopic infectious agent that requires a host cell to replicate and multiply. It is
                    composed of genetic material, either DNA or RNA, surrounded by a protective protein coat called a
                    capsid. Viruses lack the cellular machinery necessary for metabolic processes and energy production,
                    making them reliant on host cells for their survival and reproduction.

                    Viruses can infect a wide range of living organisms, including animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, and
                    archaea. They are responsible for various diseases in humans, animals, and plants, ranging from the
                    common cold to more severe conditions such as influenza, HIV/AIDS, and COVID-19.

                    The life cycle of a virus typically involves attachment to a host cell, entry into the cell,
                    replication of its genetic material, assembly of new virus particles, and release to infect other
                    cells. The ability of viruses to mutate and evolve rapidly poses challenges in developing effective
                    treatments and vaccines. Antiviral medications and vaccines are often designed to target specific
                    stages of the viral life cycle or the host's immune response to mitigate the impact of viral
                    infections.Viruses come in various shapes and sizes, and their classification is based on factors
                    such as their genetic material, structure, and replication strategy. While some viruses have a
                    simple structure, others exhibit complex arrangements, including envelopes derived from the host
                    cell membrane.</p>

                                    <li><span>Wash your hands well. You probably wash your hands after using the
                                            bathroom, before preparing or eating food, and after gardening or other
                                            dirty tasks. You should also wash up after blowing your nose, coughing,
                                            or sneezing; feeding or stroking your pet; or visiting or caring for a
                                            sick person. Wet your hands thoroughly. Lather up with soap or cleanser,
                                            and rub it into the palms and backs of your hands and your wrists. Be
                                            sure to clean your fingertips, under your nails and between your
                                            fingers. Rinse under running water. Dry your hands and wrists
                                            thoroughly.</span></li>

                                    <li><span>Cover a cough. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you sneeze
                                            or cough, then dispose of it. If no tissue is handy, cough or sneeze
                                            into your elbow rather than into your hands.</span></li>

                <h3>HEALTH <span>CARE</span> PRODUCTS:</h3>
                <p>It's important to note that while some products may claim to protect against viruses, the most
                    effective measures for virus prevention generally involve practicing good hygiene, maintaining a
                    healthy lifestyle, and following recommended guidelines from health authorities. Additionally,
                    vaccines play a crucial role in preventing certain viral infections. Here are some products commonly
                    used for health and hygiene, though their effectiveness against specific viruses may vary:</p>

                <h5>Hand Sanitizers:</h5>
                <img src="./sanitizer.png">
                <p> <b>Use:</b> Hand sanitizers are alcohol-based solutions or gels that can be applied
                    to the hands when soap and water are not available. The alcohol content (usually at least 60%) helps
                    kill a variety of germs, including viruses, on the skin.</p>
                <h5>Face Masks:</h5>
                <img src="./face mask.png">
                <p><b>Use:</b> Face masks, particularly surgical masks and N95 respirators, are designed to prevent the
                    transmission of respiratory droplets. They act as a barrier to protect the wearer and others from
                    inhaling potentially infectious particles. N95 respirators provide a higher level of filtration.</p>
                <h5>Disinfectant Wipes:</h5>
                <img src="./wipes.png">
                <p><b>Use:</b> Disinfectant wipes are pre-moistened with cleaning solutions that can be used to wipe
                    down surfaces. They are effective in disinfecting commonly touched areas, such as doorknobs, light
                    switches, and electronic devices.</p>
                <h5>Surface Disinfectants:</h5>
                <img src="./surface.png">
                <p><b>Use:</b> Surface disinfectants come in various forms, including sprays and liquids. They contain
                    chemicals that kill or neutralize viruses and bacteria on surfaces. Follow the product instructions
                    for proper application and contact time.</p>
                <h5>Hand Soap:</h5>
                <img src="./soap.png">
                <p><b>Use:</b> Proper handwashing with soap and water is a fundamental hygiene practice. The friction
                    created
                    by rubbing hands together while using soap helps remove dirt, grease, and viruses from the skin. It
                    is recommended to wash hands for at least 20 seconds.</p>
                <h5>UV-C Light Sanitizers:</h5>
                <img src="./uvc senitizer.png">
                <p><b>Use:</b> UV-C light has germicidal properties that can deactivate the DNA and RNA of viruses and
                    bacteria. UV-C light sanitizers are used to disinfect surfaces and objects by exposing them to the
                    light for a specified period. Care should be taken to avoid direct exposure to skin and eyes.</p>
                <h5>Air Purifiers:</h5>
                <img src="./air purifier.png">
                <p><b>Use:</b> Air purifiers with HEPA filters can trap particles, including viruses, from the air. Some
                    air purifiers also use UV-C light or other technologies to neutralize airborne pathogens. They are
                    beneficial in enclosed spaces to improve air quality.</p>
                <h5>Vitamin Supplements:</h5>
                <img src="./vitamins.png">
                <p><b>Use:</b> Vitamins, especially vitamin C and D, play a role in supporting the immune system. While
                    a well-balanced diet is the best source of nutrients, supplements may be recommended by healthcare
                    professionals to address deficiencies or during periods of increased vulnerability.</p>
                <h5>Thermometers:</h5>
                <img src="./thermometer.png">
                <p><b>Use:</b> Monitoring body temperature with a thermometer is crucial for detecting fever, a common
                    symptom of viral infections. Digital thermometers are commonly used for accurate and quick
                    temperature readings.</p>
                <h5>Gloves:</h5>
                <img src="./Gloves.png">
                <p><b>Use:</b> Disposable gloves provide a barrier to protect hands from coming into direct contact with
                    potentially contaminated surfaces. They are commonly used in healthcare settings and when cleaning
                    or caring for individuals who are sick. Proper usage and disposal are essential to avoid
                    cross-contamination.</p>
