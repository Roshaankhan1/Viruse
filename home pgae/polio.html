                <h4>POLIO-<span>VIRUS</span>:</h4>
                <p>Polio, short for poliomyelitis, is a highly infectious viral disease caused by the poliovirus. It
                    primarily affects young children, and in severe cases, it can lead to paralysis or even death. The
                    poliovirus is transmitted through contaminated food, water, or contact with an infected person's
                    feces.</p>
                <p>The virus attacks the nervous system and can lead to paralysis, particularly in the limbs. While most
                    individuals infected with poliovirus do not display symptoms, some may experience flu-like symptoms,
                    such as fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain. In a small percentage of cases, the virus can
                    invade the central nervous system, causing paralysis.</p>
                <p>Vaccination has been the cornerstone of efforts to eradicate polio globally. The oral polio vaccine
                    (OPV) and the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) have been instrumental in reducing polio cases
                    significantly. Various global initiatives, such as the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI),
                    aim to eliminate polio by ensuring widespread vaccination campaigns and surveillance.</p>

            <div class="about-content">
                <p><b>Significant progress has been made, with the number of polio cases worldwide dramatically reduced.
                        However, challenges persist, particularly in some regions facing barriers like conflict,
                        insecurity,
                        or limited access to healthcare.</b></p>
                <p><b>Public health efforts focus on achieving and maintaining high vaccination coverage to create herd
                        immunity, preventing the spread of the virus. Surveillance systems are crucial to quickly detect
                        and
                        respond to any outbreaks, ensuring that the goal of global polio eradication remains within
                        reach.</b>
                </p>
                <img src="./polio extra.png">
                <p><b>It's important for communities to be informed about the importance of polio vaccination and to
                        actively participate in vaccination campaigns. Continued global cooperation and commitment to
                        immunization efforts are vital to ultimately rid the world of polio and prevent its
                        resurgence.</b></p>
                <h5>Transmission:</h5>
                <p><b>Fecal-Oral Route:</b> Poliovirus is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, often due
                    to poor sanitation and contaminated water sources. Person-to-person transmission can also occur
                    through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</p>
                <h5>Clinical Manifestations:</h5>
                <p><b>Asymptomatic Infections:</b> The majority of poliovirus infections are asymptomatic or result in
                    mild, non-specific symptoms.</p>
                <p><b>Non-paralytic and Paralytic Polio:</b> Non-paralytic polio may present with flu-like symptoms such
                    as fever, headache, sore throat, and muscle stiffness. Paralytic polio, affecting a small percentage
                    of cases, leads to muscle weakness or paralysis. It can be spinal, bulbar, or both.</p>
                <p><b>Post-Polio Syndrome (PPS):</b> PPS is characterized by the recurrence of muscle weakness, fatigue,
                    and pain in individuals who had experienced paralytic polio many years earlier.</p>
                <h5>Vaccination:</h5>
                <p><b>Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV):</b> OPV is a live attenuated vaccine that provides both individual and
                    community immunity. It stimulates an immune response in the intestines, preventing the spread of the
                    virus.</p>
                <p><b>Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV):</b> IPV is an injectable vaccine containing killed poliovirus. It
                    is used in countries where the live vaccine may pose challenges, such as concerns about
                    vaccine-derived polioviruses.</p>
                <p><b>Global Immunization Efforts:</b> The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) involves
                    collaboration between the World Health Organization (WHO), Rotary International, UNICEF, the Centers
                    for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and national governments.</p>
                <h5>Eradication Efforts:</h5>
                <p><b>Progress and Challenges:</b> Significant progress has been made in reducing global polio cases,
                    with many regions declared polio-free. Challenges include vaccine hesitancy, conflict zones, and
                    hard-to-reach populations.</p>
                <p><b>Wild Poliovirus and Vaccine-Derived Polioviruses (VDPVs):</b> Wild poliovirus refers to the
                    naturally occurring virus, while VDPVs can emerge in rare instances when the live virus in the oral
                    vaccine reverts to a more virulent form.</p>
                <h5>Surveillance and Response:</h5>
                <p><b>Global Surveillance:</b> Surveillance systems are crucial for detecting and responding to
                    suspected cases promptly.</p>
                <p><b>Outbreak Response:</b> Rapid response measures, including mass vaccination campaigns, are
                    implemented to contain outbreaks.</p>
                <h5>Polio-Free Certification:</h5>
                <p><b>Certification Process:</b> Countries must meet specific criteria and undergo a rigorous
                    certification process to be declared polio-free.</p>
                <h5>Post-Eradication Challenges:</h5>
                <p><b>Ensuring Sustained Immunity:</b> Maintaining high vaccination coverage is essential to prevent
                    poliovirus reintroduction. Surveillance continues even after eradication to detect any potential
                    resurgence.</p>
                <p><b>Vaccine Research and Development:</b> Ongoing research explores new vaccine formulations and
                    strategies to improve immunization coverage and effectiveness.</p>
                <p><b><i>Understanding the intricate details of poliovirus, vaccination efforts, and the challenges
                            involved is crucial in the global initiative to eradicate polio and maintain a polio-free
                            world. Continued dedication and collaboration among global health organizations,
                            governments, and communities are necessary for the success of eradication efforts.</i></b>
